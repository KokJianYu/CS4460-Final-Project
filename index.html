                    Hello! <br> <br>
                    Welcome to a visualization of airplane incident data from the years 1995 to 2016. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately these visualizations aim to provide insight on whether or not air travel is as risky as most people imagine it to be.

                <div class="title">Aircraft accidents in the recent years</div>
                    From 2011 to 2016 the majority (63.48%) of airplane incidents were classified as incidental which means they did not involve any injuries. 
                    <br><br>
                    Within the same amount of time, data showed that only 32.8% of airplane incidents were non fatal which means that no one onboard died. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, just comparing the number of fatal, non-fatal and incidental accidents don't really give us much insight. It is possible that the few fatal and non-fatal accidents could potentially have a large amount of casualties. 
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, let us split the data by the type of injuries incurred in the next chart.

                <div class="title">Types of injuries</div>
                This heatmap shows that from 1995 to 2016 that a majority of plane incidents did not result in any injuries. 
                <br><br>
                The following heat map specifically shows that of the injuries that occurred more resulted in people dying than they did of people being seriously injured. 
                <br><br>
                Although the total fatal injuries is higher than total serious injuries, it is important to note that in most of the non-fatal accidents, majority of the passengers are uninjured with a few being seriously injured. On the other hand, in most of the fatal accident, most of the passengers end up dead. This shows that in most situations, unless if the plane ends up in a fatal crash, injuries are actually very rare in aircraft accidents.
                <br><br>
                It is also important to note that since the United States airplane crash in 2009 that killed 49 people on the plane and 1 on the ground, the United States did not have another fatal plane incident for 9 years, until 2018 when a woman was sucked out of a window on a Southwest Airlines plane which was considered a rare 'freak-accident'.

                <div class="title">Does airplane make and model correlates to frequency of accidents?</div>
                The number of accidents attributed to an aircraft model is often driven by the popularity of that plane, the routes it flies, and how many people fit onboard. 
                <br><br>
                For these reasons, the most popular planes are usually the ones with the most fatal accidents, hence why the Boeing has the most injuries both fatal, nonfatal, and incidental (non injurious). 
                <br><br>
                Particularly, the Boeing 737 is a very popular plane and because of this year and its two fatal accidents within a span of 5 months, nearly every aviation authority around the world with plane oversight has grounded their Boeing 737s. 
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Looking forward.</div>
                2010 was the worst year for plane incidents. The worst accident in 2010 involved an Air India Express Boeing 737-800 in May, when 158 passengers and crew were killed after the aircraft overran on landing at the Indian city of Mangalore. 
                <br><br>
                Researchers agree that even though 2010 was a rough year for air safety, overall industry trend was still one of improvement, with only 2009, 2007 and 2006 producing better accident rates. 
                <br><br>
                The fatal accident rate in the 1990s was one per 700,000 flights while the rate for the 2000s was one per 1.2m. Air safety is still improving and this has resulted in 100 fewer fatal accidents during the last decade than in the 1990s - on average, 10 fewer fatal accidents a year

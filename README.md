# CS4460-Final-Project

This repo is a project for Module CS4460 (Information Visualization) in Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Project Description
This final programming assignment of the term is a more open-ended data visualization challenge. We have identified five potential datasets for you to visualize (P5 datasets on Canvas). You should select one, then design and implement an interactive visualization of the data. This assignment will be done in pairs of students. Ideally, you and your teammate will take the knowledge and background that you are learning this semester about Information Visualization and put it to good use in a new, creative effort.

## Dataset 

### Aircraft incidents

This data set contains information about airplane mishaps that have occurred. These might be plane crashes or they could be more minor accidents that happened to a plane. Each data case (row) is an incident. Fields of the data set include date, location, airline, type of plane, phase of the flight, severity, fatalities, and so on.
